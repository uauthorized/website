    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a thematic deep-dive comparing the 1960s Civil Rights Movement (CRM) with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Instead of a linear report, it uses distinct, scrollable sections (Introduction, Goals, Tactics, Organization, Financial Scrutiny, Synthesis) to allow users to explore specific points of comparison. This structure facilitates a nuanced understanding, directly addressing the core question of whether BLM is a continuation or a new initiative. The user flow is guided by a top navigation bar, encouraging exploration of different facets of the movements, culminating in the data-driven 'Financial Scrutiny' section which addresses the user's specific prompt. This design was chosen for its clarity and ability to present complex, comparative information in a digestible, interactive format. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Core tenets and tactics of CRM & BLM from textbook/conversation. Goal: Compare/Inform. Viz/Method: Side-by-side text blocks and interactive cards. Interaction: Clicking cards reveals detailed descriptions. Justification: Allows for direct comparison of complex ideas. | Report Info: Financial data of BLMGNF from WPDE article ($90M raised, $29.7M to charity). Goal: Inform/Analyze. Viz/Method: Donut Chart. Interaction: Hovering over segments shows tooltips with financial details. Justification: Provides a powerful, immediate visual representation of the controversial fund allocation, making the data easy to understand. Library: Chart.js (Canvas). -->

            <p class="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg text-stone-600">
                Is the Black Lives Matter movement a modern continuation of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, or a fundamentally new initiative? This analysis explores the core goals, tactics, and structures of both movements to understand their connections and divergences. The conversation between Alicia and Mark highlights a common point of inquiry: while the fight for racial equality persists, the methods and organizational landscapes have evolved significantly.

            <p class="text-center text-stone-500 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-12">While both movements strive for racial equality and justice, their specific objectives were shaped by the pressing issues of their time. The Civil Rights Movement targeted legally sanctioned segregation, whereas Black Lives Matter confronts systemic racism in modern policing and criminal justice.</p>

             <p class="text-center text-stone-500 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-12">Both movements utilize direct action to challenge the status quo. However, the tools and platforms have changed dramatically, with BLM leveraging social media to achieve a global reach that was unimaginable in the 1960s.</p>
            <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">A cornerstone of the CRM, this involved peacefully breaking unjust laws. Sit-ins at segregated lunch counters and the Montgomery Bus Boycott are prime examples.</p>

                <div class="card bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border border-stone-200">

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Both movements have used mass mobilization to demonstrate solidarity and pressure political leaders. The 1963 March on Washington is iconic, while BLM organized massive global protests in 2020.</p>

                     <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Organizations like the NAACP were pivotal for the CRM, using the court system to dismantle segregation, famously in <em class="italic">Brown v. Board of Education</em>.</p>

                 <div class="card bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border border-stone-200">

                     <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Economic pressure was a powerful tool for the CRM. Today, this tactic has evolved into calls for boycotts of corporations perceived as complicit in racial injustice.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">Unique to BLM, hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter organize protests, disseminate information, and share firsthand accounts of police encounters, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-stone-600">BLM excels at creating media campaigns that focus public attention on specific cases of injustice, building on the CRM's strategy of highlighting individual stories to illustrate a broader problem.</p>

            <p class="text-center text-stone-500 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-12">Perhaps the most significant difference lies in organizational structure. The CRM was largely defined by centralized, often male-dominated leadership, while BLM operates as a decentralized network with an emphasis on inclusive, local leadership.</p>

                     <p class="text-stone-700">Characterized by hierarchical organizations like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the NAACP. Charismatic leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. served as national spokespeople, unifying the movement's message and direction.</p>

            <p class="text-center text-stone-500 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-12">While the core message for racial justice resonates widely, the financial management of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) has drawn criticism. This distinguishes the modern movement, where fundraising and organizational transparency are subject to intense public and media scrutiny in the digital age.</p>

            <p class="text-center text-stone-500 max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-12">The debate over whether Black Lives Matter is a continuation of the Civil Rights Movement is complex. The evidence suggests it is both. This interactive analysis allows you to explore the nuances and decide for yourself based on the information presented.</p>

                        <strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">A Continuation of the Struggle:</strong> The spirit and fundamental goal of BLM—the demand for Black people to be treated with dignity and to live free from systemic oppression—is a direct continuation of the centuries-long struggle for civil rights. The grievances have evolved from Jim Crow laws to issues of police brutality and mass incarceration, but the underlying fight for equality remains the same. The use of protests, boycotts, and direct action clearly echoes the tactics of the 1960s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong class="font-semibold text-stone-800">A Fundamentally Different Organization:</strong> Where BLM diverges sharply is in its structure and the context in which it operates. Its decentralized, technology-driven, and inclusive nature stands in contrast to the more hierarchical CRM. Furthermore, the controversies surrounding the BLMGNF's finances highlight a modern challenge. This allows for a distinction: one can support the <em class="italic">movement's meaning</em>—the decentralized, grassroots call for justice—while remaining critical of the <em class="italic">national organization's</em> financial practices and leadership decisions.
                    </p>

                        Ultimately, BLM can be seen as the next chapter in the Civil Rights Movement, adapted for the 21st century with new tools, new challenges, and a new organizational philosophy.
